# Python_automateTheBoringStuff
A place for me to store projects from Automate The Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart. (Also to motivate me to use Github more)

## Notes
- Most if not all of these are uncommented and I will not add comments to some.
- This is just a place for me to store the projects so in the future I can remember them.
- I also have a notion page where it goes more in depth to the topics in each chapter.
